# Maji Ndogo: End to End Infrastructure & Data Analytics Case Study
## ALX Data Analytics Capstone Project

### 📌 Project Overview
Maji Ndogo is a developing nation which faced an acute water crisis affecting over 60 000 surveyed locations. The government required a data-driven strategy to transition from crisis management to sustainable infrastructure development. This project is an infrastructure analysis and planning project aimed at solving a national water crisis in fictional Maji Ndogo. This study transitions from raw survey data of 60 000 records to a fully realized operational roadmap. It involves data auditing to identify corruption and the development of dynamic Power BI dashboards to track multi-million dollar budget allocations, project progress and engineer job lists.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** MYSQL (Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering).
* **Visualisation:** Microsoft Power BI (DAX and Schema Modeling).
* **Tools:** Microsoft Excel (Data Wrangling).

### 📂 Repository Structure
This project is divided into the following parts:

* **Part 1: Preparing Data:** Initial data assessment and cleaning. Established a "Single Source of Truth" by standardizing 60 000 survey records, handling missing values and performing initial SQL exploratory analysis.
* **Part 2: Querying Data:** Implemented complex SQL joins and Window Functions to uncover patterns in water source quality and queue times. Includes an audit that identified four field workers linked to corrupt data entries.
* **Part 3: Visualising Data:** Developed interactive Power BI dashboards. Focused on translating metrics (queue times, pollution levels) into executive insights for budget optimization and logistical infrastructure planning.

### 📈 Key Insights
* **Corruption Detection & Data Integrity:** Through SQL querying and analysis I identified specific data anomalies that uncovered a bribery scheme among field officials. 
* **Operational Bottleneck Identification:** Discovered that over 40% of residents faced queue times exceeding 30 minutes. Identified that repairing existing broken infrastructure (reservoirs/pipes) provided a 3x higher ROI in terms of "people served per dollar" compared to digging new wells in specific provinces. Demonstrated that repairing broken infrastructure (pipes/reservoirs) yielded a 3x higher ROI in "people served per dollar" compared to new well construction.
* **Operational Readiness:** Developed a list to transition "Backlog" items into actionable "Job Lists" for engineering teams.
  
### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the intersection of Industrial Engineering and Data Analytics. It proves that data is not just about numbers; it’s about operational integrity and social impact. By applying systems thinking to the Maji Ndogo water crisis, I successfully turned a massive, messy dataset into a prioritized, transparent, and audit-ready project management system. This ensures that infrastructure spending is directed where it will have the greatest impact on human life and operational efficiency.

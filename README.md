### 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the intersection of **Industrial Systems Engineering** and **Data Analytics**. It proves that data is not just about numbers; it’s about operational integrity and social impact. By applying systems thinking, I successfully turned a massive, messy dataset into a prioritized, transparent, and audit-ready project management system.

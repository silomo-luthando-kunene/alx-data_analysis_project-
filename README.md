# Maji Ndogo Water Projects: Data Engineering & Analytics

This repository contains 3 projects focused on solving water infrastructure and population basic water access problems, moving from global Excel analysis to granular SQL database operations and ending off with a Microsoft Power BI Dashboard visual presentation.

## 📁 [Project 1: Global Water Trends (Excel)](./[1]%20Preparing%20Data)
**Objective:** Analyzing 20 years of WHO/UNICEF data to identify urban-rural water level access disparities.
* **Key Tools:** Excel, Feature Engineering (ARC), Executive Presentation.
* **Outcome:** Strategic roadmap for UN Sustainable Development Goal 6.

## 📁 [Project 2: SQL Operational Strategy](./[2]%20Querying%20Data)
**Objective:** Auditing a 60,000-row relational database to detect corruption and automate engineering/infrastructure work orders.
* **Key Tools:** SQL (CTEs, Window Functions), Database Design.
* **Outcome:** 25,398 data-backed infrastructure interventions.

## 📁 [Project 3: Strategic Visualization & Reporting](./[3]%20Visualising%20Data)
**Objective:** Transforming audited SQL data into a multi-page Power BI Command Center for executive decision-making and project tracking.
* **Key Tools:** Microsoft Power BI, DAX (Dynamic Measures), Star Schema Modeling, Geospatial Mapping.
* **Outcome:** An interactive suite of 4 visuals identifying 3x higher ROI on repairs, gender-based safety risks, and real-time budget tracking for 25,398 interventions.

### 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the intersection of **Industrial Systems Engineering** and **Data Analytics**. It proves that data is not just about numbers; it’s about operational efficiency, integrity and business/social impact. By applying systems thinking, I turned a massive, messy dataset into a transparent analytics dashboard and audit-ready project management system.
